# AWS Sagemaker--End-To-End-Timeseries-Forecast-with-DeepAR-Algorithm
This repository aims building an end to end life cycle of time-series forecast by using AWS built-in algorithm which is DEEPAR. In the function parameters, several dynamic features were also used. 
The datsaset is "Metro Interstate Traffic Volume Data Set" which was dowloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume. I would like to thank to John Hogue for the dataset contribution. 

The dataset includes Metro Interstate Traffic Volume which is for MN DoT ATR station 301, roughly midway between Minneapolis and St Paul, MN. Hourly weather features and holidays included for impacts on traffic volume.
