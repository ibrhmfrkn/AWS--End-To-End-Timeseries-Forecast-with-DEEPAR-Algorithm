# AWS--End-To-End-Timeseries-Forecast-with-DEEPAR-Algorithm
This repository aims building an end to end life cycle of time-series forecast by using AWS built-in algorithm which is DEEPAR. In the function parameters, several dynamic features were also used. The datsaset is "Metro Interstate Traffic Volume Data Set" which was dowloaded from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume. I would like to thank to John Hogue for the dataset contribution.
